[verse]
从朗读声的清晨
直到琴声的黄昏
指引之恩
让我能够扎根

远游或还乡
您的教诲给我方向
使我强壮
永生难忘

[Chorus]
感谢您所有的爱
让我不懈不怠
每句话我的后盾
我便能够永不败
Your strength and wisdom paved the way,
You are the reason I’m here today,
For every step, for every mile,
Thank you, Dad

/[Verse2]

In the pages of life,
Through the laughter and the strife,
You are my guide,
So I never had to hide.

Every lesson taught,
And every battle that you fought,
Showed how to stand,
Wisdom in your hand.

[Chorus]

感谢您所有的爱
让我不懈不怠
每句话我的后盾
我便能够永不败
Your strength and wisdom paved the way,
You are the reason I’m here today,
For every step, for every mile,
Thank you, Dad

So here’s to you, my guiding light,
In the darkest times, so bright,
For every moment, for every smile,
Thank you, Dad, and it has been a while.
Thank you, Dad, you made it all worthwhile.
